<h1 align="center">HELLO PYTHON</h1>
<h3 align="right">An AI of chat!</h3>
<h4>RUNNING THE AI</h4>
<h1>WINDOWS</h1> 
Perhaps on windows it is very easy to run this AI. All yu need to do is install Python IDE environment. However please install Kali Linux command prompt on windows. For that
<a href="https://smarttechnicalworld.com/install-configure-kali-linux-windows-10-app/">Click here</a> Then obey the Linux instructions below. This will easy your life!

<code>Please note that Chatterbot module is installed by you</code>
<h1>Linux Distro</h1>
Open your terminal and paste these commands:

<code>sudo apt install python</code>

<code>pip install chatterbot</code>

<code>git clone https://github.com/JeffTheK/hello_python </code>

<code>cd hello python</code>

<code>python main.py</code>

Currently I am testing on an app called Termux. Maybe Hello Python maybe supported on termux and be able to run on android.
